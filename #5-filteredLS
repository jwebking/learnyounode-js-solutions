// pain in the butt using regular expressions. Took me a long time to understand that part. path.extname() wouldn't work. Kept saying undefined. The first part with the backslashes is signaling that the next backslash and . are special, although not to be taken literally. 
// it matches the word boundry of a .dir3$ so if the ending is .md of a file, the filter is looking for something that starts with . then has the matching ending of a file(md, txt, html....), and that is the last thing in that file name (what the $ does).
